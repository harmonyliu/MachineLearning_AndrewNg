# Machine Learning --- Andrew Ng 

Lecture notes, programming assignment and finished codes in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng at Coursera.

Assignment directory contains all the original assignment files (zipped). `machine-learning-ex\* `  contain all finished codes.

ex1: implement linear regression and get to see it work
on data.

ex2: implement logistic regression and apply it to two
different datasets

ex3: implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits

ex4: implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

ex5: implement regularized linear regression and use it to
study models with different bias-variance properties.

ex6: using support vector machines (SVMs) to build
a spam classifier.

ex7: implement the K-means clustering algorithm and
apply it to compress an image. In the second part, use principal
component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

ex8: implement the anomaly detection algorithm and
apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
